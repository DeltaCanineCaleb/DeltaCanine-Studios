                    <p>Funky Cube Dash is a very simple game, where you, a cube dashes through the level.<br> 
                        And there's funky 3D physics involved, hence the name Funky Cube Dash.<br>
                        This game was built in Unity using Brackeys' "How to Make a Game" Tutorial, 
                        and expanded upon once I got the basics down.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Run through 11 unique levels!</li>
                        <li>Simplistic appearance with easy controls</li>
                        <li>Wacky physics that are a joy to interact with</li>
                        <li>A pleasant soundtrack that gives the game that little extra something</li>
                        <li>Uh... a very good game! (At least I think so.)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>7/17/20<br>
                        Unity isn't the greatest with showing me lighting <i>in</i> the project without my computer
                        taking 2 years to build a lightmap. Luckily, that, and another bug with the new music, have
                        both been fixed!<br><br>
                        <u><b>Changes</b></u></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed the lighting issues in the indoor levels</li>
                        <li>Fixed an issue where the music in 1-4 wouldn't loop</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="center_text">The Musical v1.2 Update!</h3>
                    <p>7/16/20<br>
                        Wew! I didn't even expect this update to come around until not too long ago! This update is 
                        pretty big in my opinion, but don't take my word for it, look at the changelog! ...That I 
                        wrote. That would mean taking my word for it, huh.<br><br>
                        <u><b>Changes</b></u></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Undoubtedly the biggest part of this update, MUSIC AND SOUNDS! There's title screen music, 
                            music for the different levels, sounds for colliding with certain objects or falling off 
                            the stage, and it really adds to the game!</li>
                        <li>Added 6 new levels, making a total of 11!</li>
                        <li>Separated the levels into 2 worlds, Gitadora Plains and Mojiterra Desert!</li>
                        <li>Changed the level complete menu to allow backing out, and also added a bit of flavor text
                            after each level!</li>
                        <li>A dedicated color select menu! No longer are colors mapped to obscure keybinds.</li>
                        <li>Added a couple of colors as well!</li>
                        <li>Is there? Some semblence of plot? In my Funky Cube Dash? It's more likely than you think, 
                            you'll have to play to find out.</li>
                        <li>A sneaky secret button on one of the screens, with a more challenging approach to a few 
                            levels behind it.~</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="center_text">v1.1.1, with a quick fix!</h3>
                    <p>3/6/21<br>
                        I very quickly realized how inconsistent our bounce pads were, and after a long talk (and a 
                        bit of changing the code around), we got them to bounce the cube at a consistent rate.<br><br>
                        <u><b>Changes</b></u></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reworked the bounce pad to be a lot more consistent with how the player is bounced!</li>
                        <li>Adjusted levels that contained the bounce pad in order to account for the different code!</li>
                        <li>You can fully change the color of your cube now! As for how, keep an eye on @DeltaCanineGame 
                            on Twitter!</li>

                    <h3 class="center_text">v1.1 is here!</h3>
                    <p>3/6/21<br>
                        The first update, version 1.1 to the game is now here! You will have to download it again to 
                        update it, but with the new content added, I recommend you do so. (You can even delete the 
                        old version if you need to save space.)<br><br>
                        <u><b>Changes</b></u></p>
                    <ul><li>Gave the game a more dynamic title screen!</li>
                        <li>Added a 'How to Play' menu!</li>
                        <li>Added 3 new levels, for a grand total of 5! (The original two levels are levels 2 and 3 
                            respectively.)</li>
                        <li>Each level now has a name, displayed under the percentage complete!</li>
                        <li>Bounce pads can be found in the fourth and fifth levels! The physics do become a little more 
                            funky as you soar to higher heights than thought possible!</li>
                        <li>[Doesn't work fully yet] You can change the color of your cube, kinda!</li>

                    <h3 class="center_text">v1.0.1 out now!</h3>
                    <p>12/15/20<br>
                        The first public build of the game, v1.0.1, is now available for download! With exactly two
                        levels, I'm pretty sure you'll probably breeze through it. But! More levels will be coming 
                        along the way.<br><br>
                        <u><b>Changes</b></u></p>
                    <ul><li>Gave the game an icon!</li>
                        <li>The game now runs windowed as opposed to full screen!</li>
                        <li>Fixed all the build settings to make it a little better put together.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>EDIT 12/16/20: Mac Build is also available.</li>

                    <p>12/15/20<br>
                        v1.0 is not going to be publicly released, due to the fact that it was more of a test to see 
                        if I could make a build. It runs in full screen, and that's the only really big difference b
                        etween v1.0 and v1.0.1<br><br>
                        <u><b>"Changes"</b></u></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created the game! And it functions!</li>
                        <li>A whole two (2) levels!</li>
